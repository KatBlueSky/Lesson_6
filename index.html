        Over the past 60 years, humans have begun to explore our solar system in earnest. From the first launches in the
        late 1950s until today, we've sent probes, orbiters, landers and even rovers (like NASA's Perseverance Rover
        that touched down on Mars in February 2021) to every planet in our solar system. But can you name all eight of
        those planets? (Yes, there's only eight – not nine. Pluto got "demoted" in 2006.) And can you put them in the
        correct order?
      </span>
      <img src="img/system.jpg" alt="system-foto" class="inline-block-systemfoto">

      <div class="block">
        In case you're a little rusty, we'll break down some common ways to order the planets plus a few tricks to help
        you remember them going forward. Let's start with distance from <a
          href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/sun.htm" class="link-sun" target="_blank">the sun</a>.
      </div>

      <div class="block-border-solid">
        The most common way to order the planets is by their distance from the sun. Using this method, the planets are
        listed in the following order:
        <ul class="list-sun">
          <li> - Mercury - 0.39 AU from the sun</li>
          <li> - Venus - 0.72 AU</li>
          <li> - Earth - 1.00 AU</li>
          <li> - Mars - 1.52 AU</li>
          <li> - Jupiter - 5.20 AU</li>
          <li> - Saturn - 9.54 AU</li>
          <li> - Uranus - 19.20 AU</li>
          <li> - Neptune - 30.06 AU</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="block-border-dotted">
        AU stands for astronomical units – it's the equivalent to the average distance from Earth to the sun (which is
        why Earth is 1 AU from the sun). It's a common way astronomers measure distances in the solar system that
        accounts for the large scale of these distances. To put it another way, Mercury, which is closest, is 35.98
        million miles from the sun, while Neptune, the farthest, is 2.79 billion miles from the sun. Earth is 92.96
        million miles from the sun.

        <h2>How to Remember the Order of the Planets</h2>
        There are many handy expressions to remember the order of the planets. These are typically mnemonics which use
        the first letter of each planet's name to come up with a phrase that's easier to remember.
      </div>

      <div class="block-border-double">
        <h2>Here are some of the most common (and silliest) ones:</h2>
        <ul class="list-sun">
          <li> - My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Noodles (or Nachos) </li>
          <li> - My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Names </li>
          <li> - My Very Expensive Malamute Jumped Ship Up North </li>
          <li> - In each case, "M" stands for "Mercury," "V" for "Venus," and so on. You can also try to remember them
            with a few rhyming verses: </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="block-border-radius">
        <div class="block-2">For example, if you order the planets by size (radius) from biggest to smallest, then the
          list would be:

            <li> - Jupiter (43,441 miles/69,911 kilometers)</li>
            <li> - Saturn (36,184 miles/58,232 km)</li>
            <li> - Uranus (15,759 miles (25,362 km)</li>
            <li> - Neptune (15,299 miles/24,622 km)</li>
            <li> - Earth (3,959 miles/6,371 km)</li>
            <li> - Venus (3,761 miles/6,052 km)</li>
            <li> - Mars (2,460 miles/3,390 km)</li>
            <li> - Mercury (1,516 miles/2,440 km)</li>

      <div class="block-generator"> Or you could order the planets by weight (mass). Then, the list from most massive to
        least massive would be: Jupiter (1.8986 x 1027 kilograms), Saturn (5.6846 x 1026 kg), Neptune (10.243 x 1025
        kg), Uranus (8.6810 x 1025 kg), Earth (5.9736 x 1024 kg), Venus (4.8685 x 1024 kg), Mars (6.4185 x 1023 kg), and
        Mercury (3.3022 x 1023 kg). Interestingly, Neptune has more mass than Uranus, even though Uranus is larger!
        Scientists can't put a planet on a scale, so to determine mass, they look at how long it takes nearby objects to
        orbit the planet and how far from the planet those objects are.</div>

      <div class="block-visability">
        <div class="block-visability-1"> The requirements themselves are pretty straightforward. For one, we need liquid
          water. Water dissolves and transports chemicals, causing important metabolic reactions. We also need energy to
          create and sustain life, so light energy (from a warm sun and atmosphere) or chemical energy (from chemical
          reactions) needs to be present. Nutrients are required to build and maintain life. A planet with a water
          cycle, habitable atmosphere or volcanic activity can replenish and circulate nutrients [source: Lunar
          Planetary Institute]. So it may seem like the chances are small that we'll find another planet that supports
          life in our universe. Those are pretty specific requirements, after all -- maybe there's one? Two? </div>
        <div class="block-visability-2">Or maybe there are 60 billion planets in our galaxy alone that could potentially
          harbor life.
          That's right -- we're not as special as we thought. It turns out that in the Milky Way, scientists now believe
          that there are 60 billion planets in the habitable zone. The habitable zone is located where a planet is warm
          enough to keep water on the surface in liquid form without it turning into gas [source: Gannon]. The planets
          must be near a star or have cloud cover that keeps moisture locked in. With hundreds of billions of stars in
          the Milky Way, there are a lot of habitable zones out there.</div>
        <div class="block-visability-3">So that's the most recent answer we can give about our own galaxy. Which, lest
          we forget, is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy is chock-full of stars,
          each of which could potentially neighbor a not-too-hot, not-too-cold planet. Best guess that researchers have?

        <span class="inline-opacity-1"> Can humans live on Venus?
          Most astronomers feel that it would to exist on Venus. be impossible for lifeToday, Venus is a very hostile
          place. It is a very dry planet with no evidence</span>
        <span class="inline-opacity-2">Planetary surface temperatures tend to get colder the farther a planet is from
          the Sun. Venus is the exception, as its proximity to the Sun and dense atmosphere make it our solar system's
          hottest planet.</span>
        <span class="inline-opacity-3"> of water, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and its atmosphere
          is so thick that the air pressure on its surface is over 90 times that on Earth. </span>
        <span class="inline-opacity-4"> Being very close to Earth, Venus was observed by ancient astronomers from
          different cultures many times however, the first accurate observation was in 1610 by Galileo Galilei.</span>
        <span class="inline-opacity-5">Galileo saw Venus through a telescope and determined it had phases similar to the
          Moon. This helped support the Copernican view that planets orbited the Sun and not vice versa as previously
          believed.
          Since Venus is the brightest object in the sky after the Moon, and the Sun, it was given the name of the Roman
          goddess of beauty and love, the ancient Greek’s named it Aphrodite.
